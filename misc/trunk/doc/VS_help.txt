{{{1								*VS-Features*
Plugin features:~

As its name suggests, the main feature of this plugin is to add spell-checking
functionalities to VIM. 

lhVimSpell defines two operating modes ; each one being associated to a buffer.
The first mode is associated to the buffer of the text spell-checked. The
second one is a view that suggests alternatives to a misspelling. See for
instance:
    <http://hermitte.free.fr/vim/ressources/VS-capture.gif>


{{{2 							*VS-main-buffer-mode*
  Main-buffer Mode:~
    From this mode we can:
      |VS-Parse|        Parse the buffer for misspellings,
      |VS-Highlight|    Highlight the misspellings,
      |VS-Jump|         Jump from one misspelling to the next/previous,
      |VS-Change|       Change the value of the current language,
      |VS-Alternatives| Ask for alternatives.

  Main-buffer and Corrector Modes ~
    From both modes we can:
      |VS-Exit|         Exit from the spell-checking mode,
      |VS-Ignore|       Ignore the fact that the current word is misspelled,
      |VS-Add|          Add the current word to the personal dictionary.

{{{2 							*VS-corrector-mode*
  Corrector Mode: ~
    In this mode, a set of alternatives are suggested to replace the word
    which is under the cursor in the parsed buffer. From this list, we can:
      |VS-Choose|       Choose an alternative,
      |VS-Correct|      Correct the misspelled word and replace it by the
                        chosen alternative,
      |VS-Replace-all|  Replace every occurrence of the misspelled word by
                        the chosen alternative,
      |VS-Replace-buf|  Replace every occurrence of the misspelled word in
                        every opened buffer by the chosen alternative,
      |VS-Undo/redo|    Undo or redo the last action,
      |VS-Jump|         Jump from one misspelling to the next/previous,
      |VS-Toggle_Help|  Toggle the help message of the Corrector mode.

Details about the features:~
{{{2
{{{3*VS-Parse*				Available in the |VS-main-buffer-mode|
    Parse the buffer for misspellings ~
	Default key bindings: |VS_map_leader|r and <F4>

      This action issues two calls to |IA-spell|. It first updates the list of
      misspelled words within the edited document (or the visually-selected
      area), and then |cache|s their possible alternatives. It also
      |VS-Highlight|s the misspellings.
  
      This must be done at least once before using the other features of this
      plugin. 
      Note: Enter in the spell-checking mode, if not yet within.
      Note: In visual-mode, it will parse the selected text only!


{{{3*VS-Highlight*			Available in the |VS-main-buffer-mode|
    Highlight the misspellings ~
	Default key binding: |VS_map_leader|s
	[not yet automatic]

      Switches all the misspelled words into the Error-Syntax style.
      Note: Enter in the spell-checking mode, if not yet within.


{{{3*VS-Jump*			Av. |VS-main-buffer-mode| & |VS-corrector-mode|
    Jump from one misspelling to the next/previous ~
	Default key bindings: <M-n> / <M-p> , and
	                      |VS_map_leader|n / |VS_map_leader|p

      Puts the cursor under the next/previous misspelling.
      In |VS-corrector-mode|, it also updates the alternatives proposed to
      match the new current misspelling.


{{{3*VS-Change*				Available in the |VS-main-buffer-mode|
    Change the value of the current language ~
	Default key binding: |VS_map_leader|L

      Changes the value of the option |g:VS_language| in order to be turn
      after turn: "American" or what is your default value for
      |g:VS_language|.  
      BTW, this feature REQUIRES you have installed my |triggering| plugin,
      otherwise it won't be enabled.


{{{3*VS-Alternatives*  			Available in the |VS-main-buffer-mode|
    Ask for alternatives ~
	Default key bindings: |VS_map_leader|a and |VS_map_leader|<tab>

      Opens (if not yet opened) the corrector-window and lists suggested
      alternatives to the current word (i.e. word under the cursor) if
      misspelled.
      This switches to the |VS-corrector-mode|.

}}}3
   - - - - - - - - - -
{{{3*VS-Exit*			Av. |VS-main-buffer-mode| & |VS-corrector-mode|
    End of Spell-checking ~
	Default key binding: |VS_map_leader|E

      Closes the corrector-window (if opened) and un-highlights the
      misspellings.
      Note: Exit from the spell-checking mode.


{{{3*VS-Ignore*			Av. |VS-main-buffer-mode| & |VS-corrector-mode|
    Ignore the fact that the word is misspelled ~
	[dictionary management]
	Default key bindings: mbm -> |VS_map_leader|i ; cm -> i

      The word is added to the file ./.spell/ignore-list. If you want to
      change some of the words, edit the file and remove the words you don't
      want to be ignored anymore.


{{{3*VS-Add*			Av. |VS-main-buffer-mode| & |VS-corrector-mode|
    Add the word to the personal dictionary ~
	[dictionary management]
	Default key bindings: mbm -> |VS_map_leader|* or & ; cm -> * or &
	

      The word is added to the personal dictionary which is dependent of the
      current language. Typing '&' adds the word in lower case.

      This issues a call to |IA-spell|.

      When using |Aspell|, if the word to add is accentuated (or contains non
      alphanumeric characters), this function will propose to directly insert
      the word into the dictionary as if |g:VS_aspell_add_directly_to_dict|
      was set to true. Hence, all the corresponding warnings apply.
      This way of proceeding comes from the fact I wasn't able to add
      accentuated words to the personal dictionary through the pipe protocol
      with |Aspell| .33.5 alpha compiled with MinGW and used under Windows NT.
      Any hint/comment on this point is welcome.

      Deleting a word from the dictionary is out of topic here but quite easy
      indeed with |Aspell|. I have identified for instance with the version
      .33.5 alpha the files fr.pws (for French) and english.pws. Deleting the
      line of the word no longer desired and reducing the last number on the
      first line should do the trick.

   - - - - - - - - - -
{{{3*VS-Choose*	 			Available in the |VS-corrector-mode|
    Choose an alternative ~
	[correction]
	Default key bindings: {any-vim-way-to-move}, <tab> and <s-tab>

      An alternative is considered chosen if the cursor (in the corrector-
      window) is on the line of the alternative.
      <tab> and <s-tab> have also been mapped to jump from one alternative to
      the next/previous.


{{{3*VS-Correct*			Available in the |VS-corrector-mode|
    Correct the misspelled word ~
	[correction]
	Default key bindings: <cr>, <2-click>, {number}

      The current misspelled word is replaced by the chosen alternative.

      The alternative can also be chosen by directly typing its {number}+<CR>.

      If the current word within the main-buffer differs from the misspelling
      considered within the corrector-buffer, nothing is done.

      
{{{3*VS-Replace-all* 			Available in the |VS-corrector-mode|
    Repl. every occurrence of the misspelled word ~
	[correction]
	Default key binding: A

      Every occurrence, in the main-buffer, of the misspelling is replaced by
      the chosen alternative.


{{{3*VS-Replace-buf* 			Available in the |VS-corrector-mode|
    Repl. every occurrence of the misspelling in every buffer ~
	[correction]
	Default key binding: B

      Every occurrence, in every opened buffer, of the misspelling is replaced
      by the chosen alternative.


{{{3*VS-Undo/redo*			Available in the |VS-corrector-mode|
    Undo/redo the last action ~
	[correction]
	Default key bindings: u or <C-R>

      Undo/redo the last action that has occurred in the main buffer. This is
      helpful to undo a change without (because we haven't clicked on the
      right line for instance) leaving the corrector window.
  

{{{3*VS-Toggle_Help*			Available in the |VS-corrector-mode|
    Hide/Display help ~
	Default key bindings: h and ?

      Display or hide a several lines help message that sums up the different
      key-bindings defined within the Corrector-Mode.

{{{2							*VS_filetypes*
  Filetypes supported~

lhVimSpell is on its way to support any filetype.

|Aspell| is already aware of TeX syntax, html/sgml-like syntax and URLs.
|Ispell| also supports groff.

lhVimSpell is able to parse _only_ comments and strings from buffer of any
filetype -- considered as programming languages & scripts .
This functionality requires Vim 6.2+ and |searchInRuntime.vim|


Regarding the highlighting, lhVimSpell can take advantage of various schemes
of syntax:
- (La)TeX, bibtex, 
- if the VIM syntax file (|syn-files|) exports the "@Spell" |cluster| (Claudio
  Fleiner's syntax files: cs, dtml, html, java, and m4) 
  -> strings and comments
- if there is a "@{ft}CommentGroup" |cluster| (amiga, b, C, C++, csc, csh,
  dcl, fortran, jam, lisp, lpc, mapple, nqc, plsql, sh, vim) 
  -> comments only
- if there is a "@{ft}StringGroup" |cluster| 
  -> strings (vim ... only)
- otherwise, it sets *b:spell_options* to something like:
         'containedin={&ft}String,{&ft}Comment'
- if incorrectly highlighted, override |b:spell_options| definition into
  VS_filetype::s:AdjustSyntax()
  Or even better, use the "array" of options: *g:VS_so_contained_in_str_{ft}*

Note: It tries to recognize the exact definitions like "cString,cCppString"
even with C++.

Note: it also supports "{ft}HereDoc" (csh, perl, php, plp, sh)
    =>  cat<<END
	bla
	END

TODO: Support "embedded" filetypes, like html, php, js, ... with php buffers ;
or perl, ruby, python, ... with VimL buffers.

Tested with: Vim, C, C++, sh files, doxygenated C & C++ files

{{{2							*VS-cache*
  Internal considerations~
As the calls to |Aspell| are quite slow -- on some computers --, I decided to
cache all the calls to it.

Though, a file named ./.spell/errors-list-{language} is maintained for every
folder containing files checked with this plugin. Every time a file is parsed,
all the new misspellings detected are added (at the end of the file) with the
list of their suggested alternatives.

Hence, all in all |IA-spell| is called only twice: a first time to detect new
misspellings, and a second one to retrieve the suggested alternatives of all
the new misspellings. Once the file is parsed, the improvement is noticeable:
looking for the alternatives of a misspelling is an instantaneous operation.

All the current misspellings are remembered. It may not be useful in the long
run except for recurrent misspellings. But, the replacing feature will make
this behavior useless and hence we will be able to delete the cache-file
between two sessions. cf. |VS-todo-replace|

Regarding the highlighting policy, every word is considered OK except those
detected misspelled by the |IA-spell| tool. This is the opposite approach of
the one taken in |engspchk|. If the cached file is localized (to folder) and
often erased, this will enable to manage smaller lists of words.

Note: I plan to add a "lazy evaluation" of alternatives for future versions.

{{{2							    *VS-other-features*
Not very important features, but worth to mention ~
* Tested on a MsWin XP box, from Ms-file-explorer using cmd.exe, and from
  Cygwin using bash ;
  Pathnames of the tested files did contain spaces.
  Able to guess, and thus to automatically adjust itself to, the exact
  environment (thanks to system_utils.vim) 
* Low dependencies on other things: only |IA-spell| is required ; the
  optional external tools serve the speed ; cf. |sort|
* Can take advantage on plugins you don't need to install
* It is able to guess which one of Ispell or Aspell is installed, or it can
  rely on user's explicit configuration ; cf |g:VS_spell_prog|
* Menus placement is configurable: cf. |g:VS_menu_priority| ;
* Mappings can be overridden: cf. |VS_map_leader| for mappings ;
* Highlighting schemes can be overridden, e.g.:
      :highlight default SpellErrors ctermfg=Green guifg=Green 
	  \ cterm=underline gui=underline term=reverse
  Note: The default links `SpellErrors' to `Errors'.
* Many errors and exceptional situations detected ; 
* Several different syntax are recognized (ie works with tex, html, php, text
  files, ...), some are automatically deduced (m4, cs, ...) ; 
  will be improved in the future.
* Automatic detection of the main language (this one was easy thanks to
  v:lang): cf. |VS_language|
* Support  |Ispell|'s guesses -- If you have inputs on this feature of Ispell,
  let me know.
* Promote the chosen alternative in its list (of proposed alternatives)
  When an alternative is chosen, it becomes the first alternative that will be
  proposed the next time the "associated" misspelling in encountered.
  Note: This only works with the cached misspellings, it has no effect on
  ia-spell.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{{{1								*VS-Install*
Installation notes: ~

  Files of the plugin: ~
    The plugin is composed of several files:
      - macros/lhVimSpell.vim : the main file that must be sourced ;
      - plugin/a-old.vim : old version of the |alternate| plugin ;
      - plugin/system_utils.vim : 
      - doc/VS_help.txt : "Vim-help-doc" version this file ;
      - doc/VS_help.html : HTML version of this file ;
      - Changelog ...

    They could be downloaded as a tarball archive at:
	<http://hermitte.free.fr/vim/ressources/vim-spell.tar.gz>

    Let's note {rtp} to represent $HOME/.vim/ (on *NIX systems) or
    $HOME/vimfiles/ (on Ms-Windows systems) ; check ":help 'runtimepath'" for
    other systems. Then, to install the plugin, you could for instance
    execute:
	cd {rtp}
	gzip -cd path_to/vim-spell.tar.gz | tar xf -, 

    To install this file (the documentation), go into {rtp}/doc/ and execute
    (from VIM) ':helptags {rtp}/doc' once. You could also execute in your
    shell:
	cd doc/ ; gvim -c helptag\ .\ \|\ q
    --> cf. |add-local-help|	Instructions on installing this file

    If you want the plugin to be systematically run: move lhVimSpell.vim into
    your {rtp}/plugin/ directory.
    Or, if you want the plugin to be run only in specific situations: leave
    it into your {rtp}/macros/ directory, and source it whenever you need to.
    For instance, I execute ":runtime macros/lhVimSpell.vim" from my TeX and
    mail ftplugins.


    There are some useful and optional plugins that will enhance lhVimSpell:
      - |searchInRuntime.vim| : used to autoconfigure lhVimSpell ;
      - |let-modeline.vim| : to associate a language directly to a file.
      - triggers.vim : my |triggering| plugin ;


  Customizing the mappings:~
  								*VS_map_leader*
    All the |VS-main-buffer-mode| features are binded to keystrokes sequences
    beginning by |g:VS_map_leader|.

    Under Microsoft OSes, Motif, GTK+ and Photon GUI, when |winaltkeys| values
    "no", |g:VS_map_leader| default value is "<M-s>", "<leader>s" otherwise.

    I've decided to use "<M-s>" as a default value because:
      - "s" is like "spell" ;
      - <C-S> is already mapped (in my configuration) to ":w<cr>" for when I
	come back from Ms-Windows products that I used over a long period ;
      - 'ó' is not a letter I use in French, Ms-Windows Spanish users may
	want to change it.
    BTW, notice that "<M-s>" and "<M-S>" are two different key strokes.

    If you want to change the default mappings, three approaches are possible:
    - change the value of |g:VS_map_leader| ;
    - edit the third and fourth parts of lhVimSpell.vim (lhVimSpell/corrected
      buffer functions) and make your customizations -- not recommenced ;
    - or you can change the mappings used by forcing them into your .vimrc
      with for instance: >
	nmap <F7>c <Plug>VS_check	" check file
	nmap <F7>s <Plug>VS_showE	" show misspellings
	nmap <F7>a <Plug>VS_alt		" propose alternatives
	nmap <F7>E <Plug>VS_exit	" exit
	nmap <F7>n <Plug>VS_nextE	" next misspelling
	nmap <F7>p <Plug>VS_nextP	" previous misspelling
<   If required, I'll try to improve the customization of mappings.

    At this time, if you want to change the key-bindings used within the
    |VS-corrector-mode|, you have no choice but to edit lhVimSpell.vim. If you
    are interested in such a feature, let me know.


  Last thing:~
    I'm aware that this plugin is quite complex. It is the price to pay for
    its features. It depends on external plugins and even external (but common
    for VIM users I guess) tools. 
    For maintenance aspects, it is developed as several inter-dependant files.
    If you want to hack in the plugin, you can also look at the "developer(s)"
    version:
	<http://hermitte.free.fr/vim/ressources/vim-spell-dev.tar.gz>


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{{{1								*VS-Options*
Options: ~

Most options are global -- making them buffer-relative caused me a lot of
troubles when I wanted to spell-check several buffers.

If you want to change their values, do it into your .vimrc or any other plugin
loaded _before_ lhVimSpell.

*VS_language*	string (...) ; default based on |v:lang|
  This option defines the language/dictionary used. cf. the '--master' option
  of |IA-spell|. If your configuration is not explicitly supported, you may
  have to extend the functions s:Default_language() and s:Personal_dict() ;
  let me know about it.

  Actually, lhVimSpell tries to use (in that order):
      1- *w:VS_language* or else *b:VS_language*
      2- *g:VS_language_when_filetype_is_{&ft}*
	"Array" of variables like for instance:
	    g:VS_language_when_filetype_is_mail,
	    g:VS_language_when_filetype_is_help, ...
      3- *g:VS_language_for_programming* [default: |g:language_english| ]
	 only when 'filetype' <=> programming language
      4- *g:VS_language* [default based on |v:lang|]
  Notes: *g:VS_language_when_filetype_is_help* defaults to |g:language_english|
	 *g:language_english* defaults to "american"

  Using |let-modeline.vim| is a nice way to automatically set the language
  used with your files.

*g:VS_spell_prog* string ("ispell"/"aspell") ; default "aspell"
  This option must be used to know which |IA-spell| tool is used: |Ispell| or
  |Aspell| -- or any upcoming clone.
  If available and installed, |which| or |searchInRuntime| (cf.
  |lhVimSpell-and-searchInRuntime|) will be used to determine which one of
  |Aspell| or |Ispell| is installed and will be used.
  If neither Aspell nor Ispell are in your $PATH, set |g:VS_spell_prog| with
  the full absolute path to the program to use.

*g:VS_strip_accents* boolean (0/1) ; default 0
  Directly passed to |IA-spell| if defined.

*g:VS_aspell_add_directly_to_dict* boolean (0/1) ; default 0
  This trick enables to quicken the insertion of words into the personal
  dictionary. I guess it will work only with |Aspell|. I've tested this
  approach with Aspell .33.5 alpha ; I can't guarantee that it will always
  work with future versions of Aspell. By default, this option is set to false
  (ie. 0).
  If you want to use it, please check:
  - You are using Aspell or at least the format of your personal dictionary
    looks like: "xxxx <number_of_entries>" on the first line, while the
    following lines are made of «personal» words.
  - The personal dictionary names are correctly set within s:Personal_dict()
    regarding your |VS_language|.
  Any feedback is welcome regarding this option (and the rest as well):
  format of personal dictionaries and its everlastingness, their names
  regarding the language used, etc.

*g:VS_display_long_help* boolean (0/1) ; default 0
  Tells, next time the corrector window is opened, if the help will be
  displayed in its totality or not.

*g:VS_jump_to_next_error_after_validation* boolean (0/1) ; default 1
  When true, some operations (|VS-Correct|, |VS-Add| word to dictionary,
  |VS-Ignore| word) from the corrector window will move the cursor to the next
  misspelling.
  Note: This option used to be *g:VS_jump_next_error_after*

*g:VS_map_leader* string (...) ; default <M-S> or <Leader>s
  Defines the leader used for lhVimSpell mappings.
  Cf. |VS_map_leader| for more precise information.

*g:VS_menu_priority* number/string ; default "55"
*g:VS_menu_name* string(...) ; default "Spell &check"
  These two options enable lhVimSpell's menu to be placed wherever we wish it
  to be. For instance: >
       let g:VS_menu_priority = '40.600'
       let g:VS_menu_name     = '&Tools.Spell &check'

|g:unix_layer_installed| boolean (0/1) ; default 0
  This option actually belongs to |system_utils.vim|. It indicates (when we
  are under a Microsoft OS -- only) whether tools emulating unices tools are
  installed or not. 
  In lhVimSpell's case, it indicates whether GNU-|sort| have been installed on
  a MsWindows box.
  This option must be set into .vimrc. If not set (while |sort| is available),
  we may observe a slow down of the processing ; a VimL emulation of `sort'
  being run.
  Under a *nix box, don't bother with this option.
  Under a MacIntosh or any other box, I have no idea of what must be done. So
  let me know about the situation in order I figure out something.

{{{1								*VS-Future*
Known problems & TODO List: ~

|VS-known-problems|		Known problems
    |VS-pb-startup|		Known issues at startup
    |VS-on-windows-boxes|	Known issues on MsWindows
    |:VSVerbose|		Debugging facility
|VS-TODO|			Todo list

{{{2							*VS-known-problems*
  Known problems:~
    Setting the file-type will cancel the highlighting of misspellings ; So,
    try to avoid to reset it every time the buffer is reloaded -- this could
    be observed with the affectation of 'filetype' within modelines like with
    this file.

    When we hit '*' in the Corrector mode, a space may be needed to be hit  in
    order to activate the associated mapping.

    There is an annoying issue with 'iskeyword'. For instance, if 'isk'
    contains ":", then "dowload:" will not get highlighted.
    Unfortunately, the pattern highlighted must be '\<'.misspelling.'\>'
    Which means, highlighting "\<dowload\>" will have no effect because of the
    ":", highlighting "dowload" non automatisable as it can not be
    distinguished from the case where "wnload" (and not "\<wnload\>") is a
    misspelling.


{{{2							*VS-pb-startup*
    Problems when starting up the plugin~

    Q: Is the script correctly loaded ?
    A: try: >
	  :echo g:loaded_lhVimSpell_vim
<      If vim answer anything other than 1, it means the script has not been
       properly loaded. Check again |VS-Install|.

    Q: Why <M-s>r or <leader>sr does not produce anything ?
    A: Are you sure it is the right keybindings for your system ?
       Check them with: >
          :VSEcho map_leader
<      Then, use this result with "r" for instance. If it still doesn't
       produce anything, try to change into your .vimrc, the |VS_map_leader|
       used by lhVimSpell.
    

{{{2							*VS-on-windows-boxes*
    You are under windows~
    You may want to install |sort|, or already have it. 
    To use it, be sure it is visible from your $PATH. Update your $PATH until
    you can execute: >
	:!sort --version
<   And then set |g:unix_layer_installed| to 1 in order to tell lhVimSpell to
    use `sort' instead of its VimL emulation.

    Now, let's try to identify your problem.
    * When you execute Aspell from VIM: (use ispell instead or aspell if you
      have Ispell of course...) >
	:!aspell
<     a- You don't get any error message .... fine!
      b- You get an error message looking like: 
	   "Name of the program or file incorrect..."
	 Then, check your 'shell' option. It should points to bash.exe (under
	 Cygwin), sh.exe (with UnixUtils) or $COMSPEC (MsWindows's shell). 
      c- You get an error message looking like: 
	   "`aspell' is not recognized as an internal or external command, an
	   executable program or a batch file" [$COMSPEC variant]
	 Then, you must update your $PATH so Aspell will be visible from VIM.
	 Another solution is to set |g:VS_spell_prog| to
	 "the/exact/path/to/aspell".
      d- The error message is: 
	   "/usr/bin/bash: line1: aspell: command not found" [Cygwin variant]
	 This is the same situation as c-'s one ; but with Cygwin. The same
	 solution apply.
    
    * This time, try to run from VIM: >
	:echo system('aspell -l < '.FixPathName(expand('%')))
<     a- You get a list of all the misspellings ; then everything works fine
      b- Otherwise, your problem may lie with the values of the 'shellredir',
         'shellquote' or 'shellxquote' options.
	 Let me know if you have such trouble as |systems_utils.vim| is
	 supposed to take care of them.

{{{2							*:VSVerbose*
    Debugging facility~
    I define the command >
	:VSVerbose {level}
<   that helps me follow what is happening at some crucial steps.
      Level 0~
	- Nothing is displayed.
      Level 1~
	- Displays the exact command executed time something is piped to
	  iapell
	- Displays the exact command executed to get the list of misspellings.
	- Displays the list of misspellings found.
	- Reminds which word is added to the personal dictionary.
      Level 2~
        - Displays the text piped to iaspell in order to add a new word to the
	  personal dictionary.
	- Traces information used to build, from syntax definition, the regex
	  used to match strings.
      Level 3~
        - Displays the syntax files searched for strings definition.
	- Sets g:re as the regex used to keep the text to parse only.
      Level 4~
        - Displays the list of words that should be spellchecked, but does not
	  spell-check them ; only with non 100% textual documents.

{{{2							*:VSEcho*
    Debugging facility (bis)~
    The command >
	:VSEcho {script-variable}
	:VSEcho {script-function()}
<   can be used to display the (returned) value of variables and functions
    from lhVimSpell.

  
{{{2							*VS-TODO*
  TODO list:~
    * Manage replacement list ;				*VS-todo-replace*
      i.e. list of words to be systematically replaced by a predefined word.
      Aspell seems to use *.prepl files for this purpose. But how to manage
      them through pipes (-a option) ?
      Two possible ways (option ?) to execute the replacements:
      - can be executed on user's request,
      - can be executed automatically => map every characters -- possibility
	to study ; cf. Word_in_ment() in fr-abbrs.vim
    * Ignore some contextual word like "\oe uvre" -- with TeX
      and other expressions like for instance the labels of figures, the
      parameters to \rnode{}{}{}, and so on.
    * Cache the dictionary management requests ; delay and merge the calls to
      |IA-spell| that add words to the dictionary as long as possible.
    * Secondary dictionary.
    * Delete words from the dictionary ; Aspell does not seem to permit it
      through a piped call, while it is quite easy to perform. But is it safe
      in regard of its future versions ? Will be supported if the option
      |g:VS_aspell_add_directly_to_dict| is set to true.
    * Dedicate a sub-menu for the different options.
    * Propose a way (option) to highlight misspellings on the fly. As the calls
      to |IA-spell| can be very slow, I'm not sure this a very useful feature.
    * Check if errors-list (/ignore-list) exists before opening any window...
    * Option that decides whether we spell-check strings or not (for
      programming languages only)

    * Extension to other file types: extend the file-type2mode recognition
      function ; only TeX, ML-like and None/url are recognized for now.
      Actually, I do support only the formats supported by Aspell.
      Hint: grep for comments and string based on syntax highlight

    * Permit to toggle the highlighting of misspellings within TeXgroups
    * Ask for the language (always or never or use another language -- opt)
      when spell-checking a visual selection.
    * Being able to ask for alternatives on the fly ; i.e. not only for
      cached misspellings.
    * Fix the issue with 'isk' ; e.g. if 'isk' contains ':', then 'dowload:'
      will not get highlighted.
      The only fix I see is to use complex pattern where s:letter is function
      of the current |VS_language|, and a word limits will be defined by
      '[^'.s:letter.']\zs'.word.'\ze[^'.s:letter.']'.
      What will be wonderful is to define s:letter as a function of
      |VS_language|. At this time, I can only do it for French, English and
      Spanish... :-(
      Bad &isk for vim files ; e.g.: with "'tex\|vim'", "'tex" should be
      extracted instead of "tex".
      Support for L_isk_{lang} -> set of characters accepted to delimit words.
    * Hooks to define the language to use ; could be useful with e-mails.
    * Do some tests in UTF-8 and other non-latin1 encodings.
    * Wrap other functions exclusives to Aspell (e.g. sounds-like words and
      lists of words, phonemes, score between words).
    * Support the latest version of |Aspell|, ie: GNU-Aspell.
    * Support two characters also returned by Ispell : + and -
    * Option: display Ispell's guesses as errors.

    * Better handling of the split window for a more ergonomic plugin.
    * Option for vertical splitting of window ; could be nicest.
    * Option for displaying suggested alternatives in a popup-menu ; why not.
    * Problem: goto-next-mispelling does not enter within folds.
    * Delete unneeded code.
    * Overriding of syntax highlighting for messages echoed.
    * Improve the customization possibilities of the mappings.
    * Fix the regexs to work whatever the value of 'magic' is.

{{{1								*VS-References*
References:~

  Links to external programs ~

    The VIM editor
     Do I really need to present you this wonderful text editor ?
     Just in case, the plugin presented here has been written for VIM --
     <http://vim.sourceforge.net/>
    
    [IA]spell						*IA-spell*
     I use [IA]spell to refer to either |Ispell| or |Aspell|. Indeed, these
     tools accept a same and important set of parameters. Therefore, this
     plugin rely on this common set and can be used with either spell-checker
     ; see |g:VS_spell_prog|. Of course one or the other is needed by the
     plugin.
    
    Ispell						*Ispell*
     Ispell is the widely distributed spell-checker I use as reference for
     this plugin. 
     Ispell hasn't been tested but should be OK with this plugin.
     <http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/geoff/ispell.html>
    
    Aspell						*Aspell*
     "Aspell is an Open Source spell-checker designed to eventually replace
     Ispell. Its main feature is that it does a much better job of coming up
     with possible suggestions than Ispell does. In fact recent tests shows
     that it even does better than Microsoft Word 97's spell checker in some
     cases."
    				 © Kevin Atkinson, from Aspell's introduction.
     It takes into account the sonority of words and keyboard-layouts.
     <http://aspell.sourceforge.net/>
    
    Text Utils: sort						 *sort*
     The Text Utils are no more required on your system. 
     Neither is `sort' nor `uniq'.  However, having the GNU version of `sort'
     will greatly speedup the processing of misspellings. Note that
     Microsoft's SORT.EXE will be of no use and must be avoided ; it is not
     case sensitive (since MsDos 3.0) and it doesn't support the '-u' option
     equivalent to `uniq' -- lhVimSpell needs case sensitivity and `uniq'.

     For MsWindows systems, you will found `sort' shipped with Cygwin or
     UnixUtils. If you install either one of them, it is VERY IMPORTANT to
     update your $PATH in order that the directory where GNU-sort is installed
     appear BEFORE "%SYSTEMROOT%\system32\".
     Then, if you plan to launch VIM from the file-explorer (instead of an
     advanced shell), don't forget to set |g:unix_layer_installed| to 1 into
     your .vimrc.
     <http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/>
     <http://unxutils.sf.net/>

   Which						*which*
    If you haven't set |g:VS_spell_prog| in your .vimrc, if you haven't
    installed |searchInRuntime| and if your shell is an UNIX shell (like bash,
    zsh, sh, etc.) then, `which' will be used to determine which of |Ispell|
    or |Aspell| is installed on your system. 
    Of course, it requires any one of these spell-checkers to be visible from
    $PATH.
    

  Dependencies ~
   This plugin relies on some other plugins like:
    
   a.vim						*alternate*
    Defines some functions to go to specific windows/buffers.
    This script is CRITICAL and REQUIRED.
    As this plugin has changed since its first version, I join an usable (with
    lhVimSpell) version renamed a-old.vim in the archive.
    <http://vim.sf.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=31>
    
   Triggers.vim						*triggering*
    Big piece of script. It permits to execute one action or an other on a
    trigger -- extension of the VIM toggling feature. 
    This script is FACULTATIVE. If installed, the language |VS-Change|-ing
    feature will be automatically enabled.
    <http://hermitte.free.fr/vim/general.php#Triggers_vim>

   let-modeline.vim 					*let-modeline.vim*
    As |VS_language| can be a buffer-relative option, it could be very
    interesting to set it within a |modeline|. But modelines are restricted
    to some Vim |options| only, they can't be used with Vim |variables|.
    However, some plugins like let-modeline.vim propose a way around this
    limitation.
    Hence the two last lines of this help file ; lhVimSpell considers this
    particular file to be written in American-English and all my other files
    are considered to be written in French as |v:lang| told it.
    <http://hermitte.free.fr/vim/general.php#let-modeline_vim>
    <http://vim.sf.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=83>

   searchInRuntime.vim			*lhVimSpell-and-searchInRuntime*
    This is another plugin I wrote. It searches for files within lists of
    directories, and applies an Ex command on the file(s) found.
    Somehow, it is a kind of hybrid command between |:runtime| and: >
	$> find {path} -name {pattern} -exec {command}
<   but for Vim.
    lhVimSpell uses |searchInRuntime| to to determine which of |Ispell|
    or |Aspell| is installed on your system. If installed, searchInRuntime.vim
    have the priority over |which|. Moreover, unlike |which|,
    searchInRuntime.vim works on any system where Vim runs.

   Text Processing With Integrated Spell Checking	
    Presents different stuffs and another simple way to call |Aspell| from
    VIM: <http://www.highley-recommended.com/text-processing.html>
   
   Claudio Fleiner's vimspell.vim. 			*CF-vimspell*
    This plugins is the one that inspired me at first. It generates the list
    of misspelled words through a call to |IA-spell|, then highlights them in
    the Error syntax style. It permits to: - jump from a misspelled word to
    the next one, - add them to the |IA-spell|'s dictionary, - ignore them, 
    - and see a list of alternative words.
    <http://www.fleiner.com/vim/spell.html>
    BTW, it seems that Claudio Fleiner has written most of his syntax files
    with spell-checking concerns in mind. Thanks to him, having a correct
    highlighting policy for these types of files is a piece of cake. :-))
    
   Dr. Charles E. Campbell, Jr.'s engspchk.vim.		*engspchk*
    A really big piece of plugin! It needs no external tool. It highlights
    misspelled words, enables to jump from one to another, and manages the
    dictionary. With VIM v6.0+, it can compute alternative words ;
    unfortunately, as it is a pure Vim solution, the heuristic used (to
    propose alternatives) will not be as outstanding as the one from |Aspell|.
    I've stolen my jumping functions, and my initial TeX highlighting rules
    from this plugin.

    <http://vim.sourceforge.net/script.php?script_id=499>
     
   Matthias Veit's spellcheck.vim for VIM 6 (only ?)	*MV-spellcheck*
    Requires |Aspell| and ruby => I haven't tested it. It seems that I permit
    much more things.
    <http://vim.sf.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=131>

   Mathieu Clabaut's vimspell				*MC-vimspell*
    Plugin based on Claudio Fleiner's |CF-vimspell| and using some ideas from
    Mathieu Veit. It also wraps |IA-spell|
    <http://vim.sf.net/scripts/script.php?script_id=465>

   Johannes Zellner's Aspell.vim for VIM 6.0		*JZ-aspell*
    Another spell-checking plugin wrapping |Aspell|.
    <http://www.zellner.org/vim/autoload/Aspell.vim>

   Yegappan Lakshmanan's spell.vim			*YL-spell*
    Plugin that wraps calls to the UNIX spell-checker: `spell'. It can also
    parses selected text, and not only files. But no alternatives proposed.
